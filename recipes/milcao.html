    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Milcao or Melcao (sometimes hypercorrected to Milcado) is a traditional dish originating from 
        the Chilo√© Archipelago in Chile. The dish is a type of potato pancake prepared with raw grated 
        potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes mixed with other ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound potatoes cooked and mashed</li>
      <li>1 pound raw potatoes, peeled and grated </li>    
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 cup cup onion cut into thin slices</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cup frying oil</li> 
    </ul>    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dry the grated potatoes well with paper towels.</li>    
      <li>Cook the onion in a pan with the butter for 5 minutes until the onions have caramelized.</li>   
      <li>In a bowl, mix the mashed potato with the grated potato until you have a dough. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>   
      <li>Form balls with the potato dough and poke a hole in the middle with your fingers. Fill it with approximately 1 teaspoon 
        of the onion mix, or with your favorite filling. Close in the filling by making small pancakes.</li>   
      <li>Heat the oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat, until the oil is hot.</li>   
      <li>Place the pancakes in the oil in batches and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until golden brown, approximately 3 minutes.
